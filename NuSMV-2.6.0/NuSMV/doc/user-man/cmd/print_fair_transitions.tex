Prints the number of fair transitions of the given model. In verbose
mode, prints also the list of all fair transitions, with a limit of
$2^{16}$. The transitions are displayed as state-input-next triples,
in three possible formats: smv (default), dot and csv. Also, each
transition is tagged with a current state ID and next state ID.
