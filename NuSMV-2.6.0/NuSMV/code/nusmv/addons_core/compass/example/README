sample-sigref.smv   : NuSMV file specifying the automaton

sample-sigref.prob  : Probability file associating to some labels a
                      corresponding probability. 
                      The syntax of the file is:

                      {<label expression> : <probability>;}*

sample-sigref.lab   : Label file containing the list of labels to be
                      converted in sigref format.
                      The syntax of the file is:

                      {<uniq id> : <propositional formula>;}*


sample-sigref.nusmv : example script for the NuSMV intercative shell to
                     take the above files and generate a corresponding
                     sigref file. The script shows also how to specify
                     the label that has been choosen in NuSMV to
                     represent tau (in this case it is act=tau).

sample-sigref.xml  : The xml file generated by the script for the
                     above example. 

NuSMV.exe          : A 32bit statically linked version of NuSMV for i386
                     linux. Tested under i386 redhat 5 linux, and i386
                     ubuntu 8.04.1 Hardy Heron. 

The way to generate the sigref file is:

 ./NuSMV.exe -int -load sample-sigref.scr
