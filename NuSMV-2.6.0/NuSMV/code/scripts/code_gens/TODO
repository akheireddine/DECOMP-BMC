Possible improvements:

1.
An option to let the user provide the fields of the Class. This way is possible
to fill, partially, the declaration, the init and deinit, and to add getters
and setters; the user should be able to control which getters and setters will
be outputted.

2.
The possibility to provide the package where is located the superclass.
